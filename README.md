Personal Note: I realize this meets the bare minimum requirements of the project but real life derailed me for a little bit as I recently had a baby and in-laws came to visit.  I'm back on track now but due to the disruption could not implement any of the fancier elements.  Will continue to iterate on the project as time permits in the future.
